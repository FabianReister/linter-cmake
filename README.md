# linter-cmake

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides
an interface to [cmake-lint](https://github.com/richq/cmake-lint). It will be used
with files that have the "CMake" syntax.

## Installation

If the `linter` is not already installed, it will be installed for you to
provide a UI for the service this package provides.

### Plugin installation

```ShellSession
apm install linter-cmake
```

Inspired by linter-ansible-linting and linter-jshint
