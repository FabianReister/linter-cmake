# linter-cmake

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides
an interface to [cmake-lint](https://github.com/richq/cmake-lint). It will be used
with files that have the "CMake" syntax.

## Installation

As this plugin is based on cmake-lint, you have to install it e.g.

    pip install cmakelint

### Plugin installation

```ShellSession
apm install linter-cmake
```



### Acknowledgement

Thanks to the authors of the 'linter-ansible-linting' and 'linter-jshint' as these Atom plugins have been inspiring.
